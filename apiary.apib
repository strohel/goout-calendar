# GoOut API

Reverse-engineered documentation of goout.net API, as of 2019-01.

## IDs

GoOut uses numeric IDs for its entities (users, events, ...).

In URLs, these IDs are encoded using a variant of a `base25` encoding:
the alphabet is `a` to `y` (case-sensitive, only small letters allowed)
meaning `0` to `24`, written in little-endian order.
`aab = 0 * 25^0 + 0 * 25^1 + 1 * 25^2 = 625`.
