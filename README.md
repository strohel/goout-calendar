# goout-calendar
Simple web service that serves calendar of a goout.net user as iCalendar format

## Documentation

Reverse-engineered GoOut REST API documentation is present in this repository
in the [apiary.apib](apiary.apib) file in
[API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) format, and beautifully rendered
(including ability to call endpoints) on
[Apiary](https://strohel.docs.apiary.io/).

The [endpoints.txt](endpoints.txt) file simply lists available endpoints.
